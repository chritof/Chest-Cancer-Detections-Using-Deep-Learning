# Chest Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on automated chest cancer detection using deep learning models applied to medical imaging data (CT scans and histopathology images).

The goal is to develop and evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based models to classify lung cancer types, including:

- Adenocarcinoma
- Squamous Cell Carcinoma
- Normal/Benign cases

The system compares different model architectures and evaluates performance using standard medical AI metrics.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a deep learning classification model for chest cancer detection
- Compare different architectures (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet, Vision Transformers)
- Evaluate model performance using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
  - ROC-AUC
- Analyze model confidence and prediction reliability
